# timestamp-to-chronoviz
Script to import .txt timestamps into a Chronoviz annotation
<br><br>
To use:<br>
(1) Move timestamp .txt files to the INPUT folder.<br>
(2) Run either the Jupyter notebook script (.ipynb) or the python script (.py).<br>
(NOTE for 2) Modify the input file path as needed.<br>
(3) Script will output an annotation file for use in ChronoViz inside the OUTPUT folder.<br>
(4) Open video in question with ChronoViz.<br>
(5) Import the exported .annotation file.<br>
<br>
(Note) If opening the annotation file gives a "video not found error" or something similar to that, redirect ChronoViz to link to the correct video and it should work from there.
